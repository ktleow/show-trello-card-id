### Introduction

Trello does not provide a way to show card IDs, there are some workaround on the Internet such as having a bookmarklet to run a Javascript code to show the hidden element on card. While that works, but you have to click it everytime to toggle the card ID, this Chrome extension solves it by automatically showing it on page load.

### How to install this Chrome extension

1. Click on settings > More Tools > Extensions or open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click on Load unpacked button and locate this folder
4. Refresh your Trello page and you will start seeing the Trello card ID
